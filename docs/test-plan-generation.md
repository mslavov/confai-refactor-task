# Test Plan Generation Process in Bugzy AI

## Overview

Bugzy AI leverages AI-driven analysis to transform your project documentation
into comprehensive, executable test plans. This document explains how the test
plan generation process works from initial project setup to running tests.

## The Generation Process

### 1. Project Setup

During onboarding, the system collects essential information:

- **Project name**: Used to identify and organize your test plans
- **Documentation**: Detailed project requirements, user stories, or
  specifications
- **Base URL**: The environment where tests will run
- **Test credentials**: Account details for authenticated tests

### 2. Documentation Analysis

When you click "Generate Test Plan," our AI engine analyzes your documentation
by:

1. Extracting key functionality descriptions
2. Identifying user flows and critical paths
3. Determining edge cases and potential failure points
4. Prioritizing features by importance and risk

### 3. Test Case Creation

The AI automatically generates test cases with:

- **Descriptive names**: Clear objectives for each test
- **Step-by-step instructions**: Detailed testing procedures
- **Expected results**: Precise success criteria
- **Severity levels**: High, medium, or low priority

### 4. Test Case Review

You can review each generated test case and:

- Accept or reject individual tests
- Modify test parameters if needed
- Customize the test plan to your specific needs

### 5. Test Execution

Once accepted, tests are:

1. Converted to executable scripts
2. Run against your specified environment
3. Monitored for completion and results

### 6. Results & Bug Tracking

After execution:

- Results are displayed on your dashboard
- Failed tests can be automatically converted to Linear tickets (if configured)
- Comprehensive reports are generated for sharing with your team

## AI Technology

Bugzy AI employs advanced natural language processing to:

- Understand context and requirements from documentation
- Generate human-readable test steps
- Adapt to different application types and domains
- Learn from test results to improve future test plans

## Best Practices for Optimal Test Generation

1. **Provide detailed documentation**: The more comprehensive your
   documentation, the better the generated tests
2. **Include edge cases**: Explicitly mention boundary conditions and exceptions
3. **Update regularly**: Refresh your test plans as your application evolves
4. **Review thoroughly**: Always validate generated tests before execution

## Integration with Development Workflow

Bugzy AI seamlessly integrates with your development process by:

- Supporting continuous testing throughout development
- Providing integration with Linear for issue tracking
- Enabling quick iteration on test plans as requirements change
